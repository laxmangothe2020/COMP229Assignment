              This banking application project is developed by using <br>
              GUI application on .Net. In this project we can deposit,<br>

                we see generally in normal banking operation.

              In BMR calculator project, I have used the JavaScript<br> 
              language. This calculator estimates your basal metabolic <br>
               rate. In this project we can calculate BMR of certain<br> 
               age limit with their weight and height of a particular gender.
